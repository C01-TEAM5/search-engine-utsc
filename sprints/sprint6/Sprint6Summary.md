## Sprint 6 Summary
* Did your team finish all of the tasks in the sprint?
    * Yes, our team finished all tasks in the sprint.
* Did your team not finish all the tasks?
    * N/A. Finished all tasks.
* Did your team have any problems? Explain.
    * No problems this sprint. JIRA has been working perfectly since we switched to the "Remaining Time Estimate" field as a means of tracking story points.
* If the actual curve moves upwards, explain why would this happen?
    * The burndown chart went down fairly linearly throughout the week. The only time the curve went up as on Monday when we initially assigned the tasks to each member and split the story points up among the subtasks for each user story.
