## Sprint 3 Summary
* Did your Team finish all of the tasks in the sprint?
	* Yes, our team finished all the tasks that we set out to complete at the start of the sprint.

* Did your Team not finish all the tasks?
	* N/A. We finished all tasks.
* Did your Team have any problem? If yes, explain.
	* We didn't have any problems this sprint. We were ambitious with what we were aiming to accomplish, gained experience with new technologies (MongoDB) and were able to complete everything we planned to at the start of the sprint.
* If the actual curve moves upwards, explain why would this happen?
	* The actual curve did not move upwards for us since our user story estimates were very good at the start of the sprint. The actual curve is not as linear as the suggested curve because our group is unable to allocate story points to sub tasks. However, as instructed on the discussion board, we have been totaling up all sub-tasks into the user stories themselves. This means that when the user stories are completed, the story points on the burndown chart decrease in a step-like way.
