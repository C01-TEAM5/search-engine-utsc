### Sprint 4 Summary
* Did your team finish all of the tasks in the sprint?
    * Yes, our team finished all of the tasks assigned at the start of the sprint.
* Did your team not finish all the tasks?
    * N/A, finished all tasks in the sprint
* Did your team have any problems? Explain.
    * As we discussed with Abbas throughout the week, our team was having problems with JIRA where we could only get credit for story points once a full user story was completed (as opposed to at a sub-task level).
    * After meeting with Abbas, we received admin access to JIRA and were able to configure the system where we could use the "Remaining Estimate" functionality to allocate story points in the correct way towards sub-tasks.
    * There was also challenges completing everything early in the week ebcause of the A2 deadline.
* If the actual curve moves upwards, explain why would this happen?
    * Our curve for this week was abnormal from the prior weeks because of the issues we were having with JIRA.
    * The issues did not get sorted out until July 11th and since we were required to use a different field (the remaining estimate field instead of the story point field), we had to re-enter our story points for the week on this date. This caused major increases in our burndown chart on both the 11th and the 12th as we entered in the correct values that we had estimated at the start of the sprint but were unable to enter until this point.
    * There was also an increase on July 15th as we mis-estimated the amount of time required to complete our TEAM5-8 user story (viewing enrolled student files). We revised this number to an increase story point value which caused the actual curve to increase on this date.
