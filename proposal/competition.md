## CSCC01 Competition

**Existing Competition:** The analyzed competition was broken down into four categories (examples included).
* Large Scale: Primary search engines that users use for any general inquiry. (ex. Google, Bing, Yahoo)
* Specialized: Secondary search engines used to satisfy a specific need. (ex. Search Encrypt - secured searches, ChaCha - human specialist inquiry) 
* Academic: Search engines used for professional articles and journals. (ex. ProQuest, JSTOR, Google Scholar)
* Specialized Internal Databases: Searches only capable of handling niche datasets and inquiries specific to the database (ex. computer hard drive,  bloomberg, CRM system)

**Core Differences:** The developed search engine is unique because it solves the immediate needs of a specialized group (students and faculty at UTSC). Its purpose is a combination of a specialized internal database and an academic search engine, however, there is no current substitute to query and search for past course files at UTSC. Its appeal to users specific to UTSC gives it an advantage over its competitors. The specific scenarios where the system would be used are uploading past course documents and sharing/searching research papers with others that are a part of the UTSC network.

**Advantaged Users:** The search engine focuses on UTSC instructors, teaching assistants and students. Its features are designed to solely satisfy the needs of this group and serves limited purpose to individuals outside UTSC.

**Disadvantaged Users:** Users seeking general information not related to UTSC would not benefit from the search engine. Rather, their needs would be better serviced by a Large Scale Search Engine.
