## CSCC01 Project Summary

**Objective:** Design and develop a search engine for instructors (including teaching assistants) and students U of T. Students and Instructors can upload and search for documents. The students and instructors have the option to create an account and the uploaded files will be indexed separately to allow for file filtering. Any visitor of the application can use the query system to search through the documents.

**Key Scenario:** Every morning Adam likes to search through any new documents/papers submitted by his colleagues to stay updated on their research. He also uploads all of his lecture notes daily before each class he teaches and re-uploads them again with additional notes.

**Key Scenario:** Alice spends most of her day on her laptop. She likes to search through all of her students' uploaded files to make sure there are no assignment answers being shared. She is also very interested in her professors' research and will often follow most of their research documents.

**Key Scenario:** Naomi spends most of her day on her laptop. She frequently downloads lecture notes uploaded by her TAs/professors and submits most of her work electronically.

**Key Principle:**  Search efficiency/functionality over look and feel. The application should prioritize the search engine functionality over the look and feel of the application.

**Key Principle:**  User security is a priority and all documents need to be securely stored. Only authorized users should be able to access private/hidden uploads.

**Key Principle:**  Users must be able to register for the application as an instructor or a student and all users (including non-registered users) should be able search public documents.

**Key Principle:**  All uploaded documents need to indexed separately according to file/uploader type for quick searching and search filtering.
